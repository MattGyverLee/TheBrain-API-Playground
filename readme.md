# TheBrain API Playground

This Jupyter Notebook contains a set of cells that interact with TheBrain API. The first cell imports necessary modules and reads in API keys and target brain information from text files. The following cells define functions to interact with the API, including listing brains, scanning brains, listing types and tags, searching for thoughts, and retrieving named items. Each of these functions is demonstrated in a separate cell.

You'll want to create a private file in the same directory calle `APIKey.txt` containing just your API key on one line. In the same way, you may prefer creating a file called `target.txt` in the same directory that contains your Brain's ID.

Note: This Version of the playground only supports read-only "get" calls.
